        <h1>Understanding Huffman Compression</h1>
        <p>
            Huffman coding is a popular lossless data compression algorithm. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. The algorithm is widely used in many compression formats such as ZIP files, GZIP, and image formats like JPEG.
        </p>

        <h2>How Does Huffman Coding Work?</h2>
        <p>
            The basic idea behind Huffman coding is to use fewer bits to represent characters that appear more frequently. By doing this, we reduce the overall size of the file. The steps involved in creating a Huffman code are as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.</li>
            <li>Sort the characters by their frequency.</li>
            <li>Build a binary tree using the frequencies, where each character is a leaf node.</li>
            <li>Traverse the tree to assign a binary code to each character (0 for left, 1 for right).</li>
            <li>Encode the original data using the newly generated binary codes.</li>
        </ol>

        </div>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Example</h2>
        <p>Let's go through an example to better understand how Huffman coding works.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Frequency Calculation</h3>
        <p>
            Assume we are trying to encode the string "BCCABBDDA". First, we count the frequency of each character:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A: 2</li>
            <li>B: 3</li>
            <li>C: 2</li>
            <li>D: 2</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="graph">
            <img src="assets/huffman-frequency-chart.png" alt="Frequency chart for Huffman coding example">
            <p class="description">A frequency chart for the string "BCCABBDDA".</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Building the Huffman Tree</h3>
        <p>
            Now we create a binary tree based on these frequencies. We start by selecting the two least frequent characters, C and A, and combine them into a new node with a frequency of 4. We repeat this process until the tree is complete.
        </p>

            <p>Steps in building the Huffman tree.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Assigning Codes</h3>
        <p>
            Once the tree is built, we traverse it to assign binary codes to each character. For example, the binary code for B might be "0", while A might be "110". Characters that appear more frequently will have shorter codes.
        </p>

        <div class="graph">
            <img src="assets/huffman-binary-codes.png" alt="Binary codes assigned using Huffman tree">
            <p class="description">The binary codes assigned to each character based on the Huffman tree.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Use Huffman Coding?</h2>
        <p>
            Huffman coding is very efficient, especially when dealing with text that contains characters with varying frequencies. It's used in a variety of applications, including file compression tools and multimedia formats. Its ability to reduce the file size without losing any data makes it highly valuable in many systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lossless compression, meaning no information is lost.</li>
            <li>Highly efficient for compressing text and other data types.</li>
            <li>Widely used in real-world applications, such as GZIP, PNG, and JPEG formats.</li>
        </ul>
